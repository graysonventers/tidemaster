### A full stack, surf report application reminiscent of Surfline and Magicseaweed. 

#

> ### General Functionality:
> This app currently takes in JSON sample data provided by MagicSeaweed.com. The app displays the processed data to the user by surf spot location. Each surf report displays wave and weather conditions for that location.
#
> ### User register/login access functionality:
> The user has the option to create an account and/or log in. A logged in user has access to their own dashboard that grants them the ability to add any number of surf spot locations to their favorites. Those favorites are displayed to the user in their dashboard.

#### I built this application solo with React/Redux on the frontend and the server Nodejs/Express with MongoDB/Mongoose on the backend.
